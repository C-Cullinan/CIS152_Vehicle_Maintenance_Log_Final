This is the progression of my final project for CIS-152, Data Structures. It includes the various files as I worked through creating the application. This application is a vehicle maintenance log, used to log, track, and sort current and future maintenance performed, with various features. It includes the use of Linked List Mimic and Priority Queue data structures. It also includes Selection Sort Mimic Methods, using pythons 'Lambda' function to sort the maintenance logs, iterating over each item and appending to a new sorted list/log.
